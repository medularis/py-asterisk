py-Asterisk: A Python Interface to Asterisk
===========================================

.. note::
   This software is a fork of *pyst*, hosted at
   http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyst/.
   Most of the code came from there, and it was licensed under
   PSF and LGPL licenses.


Development status
------------------

The code quality is between alpha and beta stages.


Python compatibility
--------------------

Python 2.6 and 2.7.

We also intend to make this to run on Python 3.2+ as soon as possible.
